# Gregarious Aggregates

## Instructions

* Use aggregate functions as you run queries to answer the following questions. You will have to search the internet for some of them. Try to use aliases for more informative column headings!

1. What is the average cost to rent a film in the Sakila stores?

2. What is the average rental cost of films by rating? On average, what is the cheapest rating of films to rent? Most expensive?

3. How much would it cost to replace all the films in the database?

4. How much would it cost to replace all the films in each ratings category?

5. How long is the longest movie in the database? The shortest?

6. For customers with id numbers 1 through 4, display the total amount they have paid.

### Hint

* Consult the MySQL documentation on [aggregate functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-by-functions.html) for a summary of the available functions.

### Bonus

* Look up how to sort the results from the above queries, in both ascending and descending order.
