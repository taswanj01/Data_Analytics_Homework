This project uses D3, JavaScript, HTML and a Python server to display a visual analysis of health risks vs. age, income and poverty in the U.S. using data from https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml

To properly view, you can host the page using "Python -m http.server" and then visit http://localhost:8000/
