          <h2>Quick analysis of health risks vs. age, income and poverty in the U.S.</h2>
          <br><br>
          <p>There are many factors at play when it comes to what correlates to what in terms
            of why people within certain age groups are in poverty, smoke or lack health care.
            With a median age group between approximately 34 and 44 for most all states, we see
            health risks percentages vary. Other factors such as various state programs and other
            federal programs are definite factors as to why different states have varying percentages
            of various health risks. States with higher household incomes obviously will have lower 
            poverty rates. There are many more questions to be asked and further opportunities
            to dig further in research along with this visualization that will lead to more concrete
            explanations as to why the health risk factors vary as they do. </p>
